# Logo Generator

## Description

This is a logo generator for my Module 10 Challenge. Its function is to create simple logos consisting of three types of shapes (Square, Circle, and Triangle), and a three-lettered name for your logo. For coloring, you can choose between broad color names, or a hexadecimal code.

## Installation

You will need Inquirer and Jest for this program. In the terminal, type "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" and "npm i jest@29.7.0" to install the required packages. If you ever find a problem, follow the terminal's directions to fix them. It should tell you what commands you have to type in.
You could also simply use "npm install" or "npm i" to download any of the

## Usage

In the terminal, type in "node index.js" and begin the process.

First type in the three initials of the logo. If you type more than three characters, you won't be able to save the logo initials.

After typing the initials, you can select the three options of shapes: Square, Circle, or Triangle.

Afterwards, you have to say the color you want on your logo's initials and shape. You can choose either a broad color name, or a hexadecimal color code. Note that if you follow the broad naming scheme, the code uses the CSS/HTML coloring scheme.
